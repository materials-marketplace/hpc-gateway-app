## Interacte with HPC through MarketPlace proxy

### Materials Cloud deployment

Since it deployed using Materials Cloud CSCS resources provided by EPFL, it is only for test purpose and MarketPlace users who what to use it need to contact Jusong Yu @unkpcz (jusong.yu@epfl.ch) to add your MarketPlace account to the whitelist.

## How to deploy app to heroku (for Materials Cloud deployment)

Set all the ENV variables in heroku dashbooard. Check `cscs.env.template` for all variables needed.

Install the Heroku CLI
Download and install the Heroku CLI.

If you haven't already, log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key.

```
$ heroku login --interactive
```

Clone the repository
Use Git to clone mp-hpc's source code to your local machine.

```
$ heroku git:clone -a mp-hpc 
$ cd mp-hpc
```

or in the repo add heroku remote repo to push

```
$ git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/mp-hpc.git
```

Deploy your changes
Make some changes to the code you just cloned and deploy them to Heroku using Git.

## How to deploy the infracstructures and run hpc-app on IWM HPC.

The firecrest on MarketPlace firecrest server need to be started. 
Go to `firecrest/` folder of `hpc-fire` server and run `docker-compose up -d`. 
The changes of firecrest deployment that needed on MarketPlace HPC can be found on https://github.com/unkcpz/firecrest/pull/1

Then need to start the hpc-app to communicate to the firecrest. 
Since the hpc-app is in the private internal network, we use MarketPlace broker to talk to public network.
Go to the hpc-app repo and run `python app.py` (WIP: using docker-compose to start so the dependencies are not needed).
This will start the hpc-app and the `rpc-brocker` (should be optinonal for the hpc-app accessable deployed on public network).
